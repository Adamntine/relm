# Relm v5.0

Relm is a community of artists, engineers, philosophers, and spiritual thinkers making a new kind of home on the internet.

Specifically, we're making a browser-based world that enables "virtual locality"--providing a way to be together with friends online in a community that meets more of our universal human needs than today's social networks do. Think of it as personal growth, spirituality-lite, and community, all being grown inside a browser so it's readily available and easy to use.

See https://www.relm.us for more info.

## Getting Started

To run Relm 5.0 locally, clone this repo, then:

TODO: mention Postgresql setup.

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

This should start both the backend server and frontend client. Visit http://localhost:8080 to try it out.

## Visit Us?

We're building a community around personal growth and spiritual-lite practices in an online space that gives us virtual locality. Interested? Check out https://www.relm.us and maybe join us on Discord.
